Pretrained models come as an archive that contains all three models (speaker encoder, synthesizer, vocoder). 
The archive comes with the same directory structure as the repo, and you're expected to merge its contents with the root of the repository. For reference, the GPUs used for training are GTX 1080 Ti.
